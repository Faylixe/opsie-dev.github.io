title  : "Spleeter: A fast and state-of-the art music source separation tool with pre-trained models"
---
We present and release a new tool for music source separation
with pre-trained models called *Spleeter*. It was designed with
ease of use, separation performance and speed in mind.

<!--more-->

*Spleeter* is based on *Tensorflow* and makes it possible to:

- Separate audio files into 2, 4 or 5 stems with a single command
  line using pre-trained models.
- Train source separation models or fine-tune pre-trained ones 
  with *Tensorflow* (provided you have a dataset of isolated sources).
