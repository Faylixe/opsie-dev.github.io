_Source separation_, _stem separation_ or _de-mixing_ are all
different ways of referring to the same problem of recovering
the mono-instruments tracks that were mixed together to produce

In this presentation we come back on our journey to open
sourcing <a href="https://github.com/deezer/spleeter" target="_blank">Spleeter</a>
library, from doing the ground research, training the models,
to releasing them. We put emphasis on the technological challenges
that had to be solved as well as the practical and legal considerations
that came into play.
